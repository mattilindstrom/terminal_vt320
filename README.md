# Color palette files for the DEC VT320 look
The DEC VT320 terminals were known for their soothing amber phosphor color, very legible and easy on the eyes.
This project has palette files for Konsole (`VT320Amber.colorscheme`) and WezTerm (`.wezterm.lua`).

The primary text color is a fairly good RGB match for the original. Colors 1-8 have been picked to be subtly noticeable, but still fitting to the theme.

# Installation
## Konsole
1. Save `VT320Amber.colorscheme` in:
	- ~/.local/share/konsole/ (user-local) or
	- /usr/share/konsole/ (system-wide)
2. Restart or reopen Konsole.
3. In Settings → Edit Current Profile → Appearance, select VT320 Amber.
## WezTerm
Merge with your existing `~/.wezterm.lua`.
